# REST API with Express.js & PHP Backend for MySQL Database

## Overview

This repository hosts the code for developing two distinct backend systems: one using Express.js and the other using PHP. Both of these backends are designed to facilitate interactions with a MySQL database, enabling a wide range of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a specified database table.

## Features

- **Express.js Backend:** Built on Node.js, it offers a robust and scalable infrastructure for handling API endpoints, routing, and core backend functionality.
- **PHP Backend:** This component efficiently manages database operations, ensures data consistency, and enables seamless communication with the MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Node.js and npm
- Express.js
- PHP
- MySQL Database

## Getting Started

To set up and run these backends within the same repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/OsquiMenacho28/Express.js_and_PHP_Backend.git

```

2. **Express.js Backend:**

   - Navigate to the `api_express` directory.
   - Install Node.js dependencies by running `npm install`.
   - Start the Express.js Application: `npm run build`.

3. **PHP Backend:**

   - Head to the `api_php` directory.
   - Configure the PHP backend to connect to your MySQL database by modifying `database.php` with your database credentials.
   - Ensure your PHP environment is correctly configured and run the PHP backend using your `web server`.
   - Start the Vue.js & PHP Application: `npm run serve`.

You now have both the **Express.js** and **PHP backends** up and running, offering a comprehensive backend API for your CRUD operations.
